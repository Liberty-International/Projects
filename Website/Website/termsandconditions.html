	liability for any action (s) and/or inaction(s) of such third parties and/or its agents, and shall not be liable for any delay or loss of any kind, which

	declaration or other submission filed on the Customers behalf;<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>b. </strong>
	In preparing and submitting customs entries, export declarations, applications, security filings, documentation and/or other required data, the Company
	relies on the correctness of all documentation, whether in written or electronic format, and all information furnished by Customer; Customer shall use
	reasonable care to insure the correctness of all such information and shall indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any and all claims asserted and/or
	liability or losses suffered by reason of the Customers' failure to disclose information or any incorrect, incomplete or false statement by the Customer or
	its agent, representative or contractor upon which the Company reasonably relied. The Customer agrees that the Customer has an affirmative non-delegable
	duty to disclose any and all information required to import, export or enter the goods.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>7. Declaring a Higher Value to Third Parties</strong>

<p>
	<strong>10. Advancing Money.</strong>

	<strong>Policies and Client Recommendations</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The Liberty International companies take your privacy very seriously. We share a commitment to protect your privacy and the confidentiality of your
	information. As providers of services that involve compiling sensitive information, protecting the confidentiality of that information has always been a
	top priority for us. The information we collect and the extent to which we use it will vary depending on the product or service involved. This privacy
statement explains the terms and conditions associated with the collection and use of data and documentation, and how you can correct or change it.	<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Our privacy policy is founded on basic principles of trust, ethics and integrity which are the hallmark of our mission statement.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The information you provide will be used to fulfill your requests for information, to send you information that we feel might be of interest to you and to
	service your international transactions in the normal course of business. We will also use your feedback to improve the content and structure of our Web
	site and services. This information will not be rented or sold to any other organizations.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	We collect only the information necessary to consistently deliver responsive products and services and as various state, federal and international law
	dictates in the handling of your logistics transactions.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to ensure information security. Our staff is required to respect the confidentiality of all
	customer information.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	We limit how, and with whom, we share customer information. First and foremost, we do not sell lists of our customers. We may be required by law or
	regulation to disclose information to third parties - for example, in response to a subpoena, to prevent fraud, and to comply with rule of, or inquiries
	from, industry regulators.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	We may occasionally communicate with you via e-mail with information on new products and services. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the
	future, please let us know by sending an e-mail to dconboy@libertyint.com and place "Stop Email" in the subject line or by calling us at 401-727-1776 ext.
	163 or by writing to us at 470 Main Street, Pawtucket, RI 02860 Attn: Danielle Conboy.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Marine Insurance and Cargo Claims</strong>
</p>
<p>
	All of our clients are strongly encouraged to secure their own marine insurance policy to cover all air and ocean cargo for which they have an ownership
	interest during transport. Airlines, steamship lines and trucking companies have very limited liability in the event of cargo loss or damage and will not
	accept claims for transport delays. An importer's only recourse, outside of these limits, is through their own cargo insurance policy. If you are not
	currently insuring your shipments, please contact your Liberty representative for a referral or a quotation.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Please note that your Customs import bond does not cover your company against cargo loss or damage!</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Please note that according to all airline, steamship line and trucker terms and conditions, claims against cargo loss or damage, regardless of liability
	and/or insurance coverage, will not be processed by the carrier until full payment is made for transport services. In these cases your Liberty or
	International Delivery Service invoice, therefore, must be paid in full before the formal claim is made. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Strict time limits apply to the filing of preliminary and formal claims for all modes of transport. Please contact your Liberty representative for details
	regarding those timelines and notify us immediately of any loss or damage related to your cargo.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Invoicing &amp; Credit Memo Processing</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Should it become necessary for Liberty to issue a credit memo against a particular shipment, it will be mailed to your company along with a clear
	explanation of the reason for the credit (to be noted in the remarks section of our invoice). Our financial services group will track all credit memos to
	be sure they are properly deducted or applied and will periodically notify you of any unused credits. International transactions are complicated and offer
	unique challenges in the billing process. We are implementing process changes to help eliminate additional bills and credits whenever possible. We also ask
	that your accounts payable staff confirm credits have not been previously deducted before including them in a future payment. Please take the time to
	update us whenever your billing contact or accounts payable contact information changes to insure proper communication.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Payment Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Unless credit terms have been offered by Liberty to your company in writing, our invoices are payable upon receipt (as noted thereon). It is very important
	that any questions or discrepancies are communicated to your Liberty representative immediately upon receipt of our invoice and that you carefully review
	the Customs entry copy provided in our invoicing backup. Any changes to your Customs entry must be made within 10 business days of cargo clearance so we
	must receive notification of changes no more than 8 business days after clearance date. After the 10 day window has passed, the entry must be "protested"
	through a lengthy, fixed, Customs defined process if corrections are required. As you know, duties are due and payable to Customs 10 business days after
	release of your shipment. Should payment not be made, Customs issues liquidated damages/fines against the importer of record. You, as the importer of
	record, have the obligation to insure your Customs entries are correct and duty payment is made in a timely fashion. CBP requires us to advise you of the
	following on a yearly basis: <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	"If you are the importer of record, payment to the broker will not relieve you of liability for Customs charges (duties, taxes, or other debts owed
	Customs) in the event the charges are not paid by the broker. Therefore, if you pay by check, Customs charges may be paid with a separate check payable to
	"Bureau of Customs &amp; Border Protection" which will be delivered to Customs by the broker. " <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Duty payments may also be made by the importer via ACH (electronic funds transfer) or PMS (Periodic Monthly Statement - monthly settlement of duties with
	CBP). Please contact your Liberty representative for additional information regarding these programs. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Customs Bonds</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Please be aware that if a valid continuous bond is not on file for the importer at time of entry, Liberty will prepare a single transaction bond in order
	to secure a timely Customs clearance. We will invoice you for single entry bond charges according to our current bond charge schedule. As these funds must
	be surrendered to the bonding company in a timely manner, payment on these transactions must be made within ten days of our invoice. <strong></strong>
