                        <p>Please allow me to introduce you to the newest member of the Liberty Team.  Her name is Colleen Fanning and she will be working in Liberty’s Client Services Division.  Client Services has gotten to know Colleen over the past few weeks and wanted to tell you a little about her so you can get to know her too!</p>
                        <p>Colleen went to the University of Rhode Island and recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration with a Major in Accounting.  During Colleen’s junior year and part of her senior year, she interned at Collette Vacations in the Accounting Department (A current Liberty Client) and also briefly worked in Group Operations.  Colleen also bartended during her entire college career, working at TGI Fridays, Fat Belly’s and NYLO Hotel.   Very fun!  For the past 7 months, Colleen held a temp position at Covidien (medical devise and pharmaceutical company) as a Remote Data Capture Administrator in the Clinical Affairs department.  Her department helped manage three new clinical systems that stored all information about any products Covidien offered.  Colleen also helped train throughout the company in those systems along with External users (doctors, etc.) that needed access to patient information.</p>
                        <p>Colleen grew up in Smithfield, RI and is a big Patriots and Celtics fan, going to at least one game a year.               </p>
                        <p>Colleen’s old roommate has season tickets to the Pats 11 rows up from the 50 yard line.  We are working on getting her name and address.</p>           
                        <p>Colleen is dating and has been with her boyfriend for almost 9 years….friends for the first eight, how sweet!   </p>
                        <p>Colleen currently lives in Pawtuxet Village and found out that she is neighbors with Caitlin (small world).</p>
                        <p>Colleen loves to travel and in the past year has been to Ireland, St. Thomas and Las Vegas (but she won’t tell us what happened there). </p>

                                    programs Children’s Friend offers the community and the challenges lower income families face when schools are closed for the summer. CF&amp;S works

                                    <strong>Role of the Broker- CBP Holds Open Forum with the Boston Brokerage Community</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    7/13/12: Customs &amp; Border Protection gave the Boston brokerage community the opportunity to provide input on CBP’s efforts to update the customs broker
                                    regulations, more specifically; 19CFR Part III.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Elena Ryan, Acting Director-Trade Facilitation and Administration, Office of International Trade and Anita Harris, Chief of Broker Compliance Branch,
                                    Office of International Trade provided an interactive forum for CBP and licensed customs brokers to share their ideas and voice their concerns regarding
                                    continuing education for licensed brokers, bona fides (ensuring the validity of a person or enterprise importing into the U.S.) and the broker permit pilot
                                    (exploring ways to better align regulations with modern business practices by allowing brokers to have a local permit in ports without a licensed broker
                                    permit qualifier).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The brokers and CBP discussed ways to establish a continuing education program that could be monitored by the Federal Government but would take into
                                    consideration the needs of businesses (brokers and importers) that depend on continuing education to suit their customer’s needs and business practices.
                                    Currently there are approximately 12,500 “active” licensed brokers in the United States. How will CBP monitor or track diverse educational requirements?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Discussions regarding bona fides addressed concerns the brokerage community has regarding their compliance in validating the information they receive from
                                    potential importers vs. a broker who does not require the same documentation, ways to check validity (websites, documents, etc), and where the broker’s
                                    responsibilities end and CBP’s begin.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The broker permit pilot discussion addressed the concerns of brokers who want to do entries in ports that can’t be supported by RLF (remote location
                                    filing). Currently, only entry types 01 (formal consumption entries) 11 (informal entries) can be filed through RLF. In September 2012 type 03 (consumption
                                    CVD/ADD entries) will be allowed, but only through ACE.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    CBP expects to hold this open forum in all major U.S. ports.
