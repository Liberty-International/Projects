                	<p><big><big><strong>By utilizing Libertyâ€™s marine insurance policy and our partnership with Roanoke Trade, importers and exporters receive quality insurance and risk management services in the transportation of their goods.  The probability of sustaining a loss during transit may be greater than you think. </strong></big></big></p>
                    <p><strong>As your freight forwarder, Liberty understands the importance of clarifying the regulations surrounding marine insurance coverage and liability for your overseas shipments.</strong>&nbsp;  Many importers believe that in cases of loss or damage, the freight forwarder reimburses the importer of record for the full claim value and then follows up with the carrier through a claim process to recover damages.  This is a misconception.</p>

                    <p><strong>The below listed average liabilitly limitations of the carriers usually apply: </strong> </p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Air:  $9.07 per LB, $20 per kilo</li>
                        <li>Truck: $0.50 per LB</li>
                        <li>Ocean: $500 per shipping unit</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <strong>The freight forwarder is neither responsible nor liable for losses or damage to your cargo.</strong>
                    
                    
                    Freight forwarders and brokers can neither advance money on a claim, nor accept deductions on invoices issued for services performed.  Liberty can, however, assist in placing insurance on any shipment at the time of booking, or provide an analysis of your current insurance program to ensure proper coverage is provided. &nbsp;Liberty can assist in filing claims against airlines, steamship lines, truckers, and warehouses. &nbsp;Shipments routed under CIF, DDU, and DDP terms are booked and arranged by your overseas vendors.  Are you comfortable that the insurance they place on your cargo will fully cover you for loss, damage or theft from their factory to your door?  Even if your supplier has placed insurance on a shipment, Liberty can place a contingency policy at the time of booking to cover against claims not covered under an existing policy. &nbsp;Cargo insurance is unregulated, and marine insurance companies vary widely in coverage and expertise so it is important to understand exactly what you are covered against.  Are you covered in the event of:
