                    <strong>We capitalize on our origin partner resources to the advantage of our clients.</strong>  Together, we operate under block space agreements that specifically allow for surges in volume. We also maintain relationships with several airlines & steamship lines on each trade lane to insure capacity and service in the event of labor actions, trade lane disruption or volume spikes. This strategy allows us the flexibility needed to provide you with the best possible service level.  Uninterrupted service, no matter the challenge, is one of our highest priorities.

Sea/Air is priced as an all-in rate per kg for all of the transportation costs from the port of origin up to the final airport or point of destination.  This enables us to offer the same seamless service for all of our multi-modal options.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Our pricing philosophy is based on a system of simple billing with as few line items as possible.  We rigorously negotiate with carriers and regularly confirm pricing through second sources for competitive advantage.  Our pricing model is service oriented.  We offer fair market pricing for high quality, reliable service.  We maintain a history of fuel surcharges on our web site and each element of our freight costs is separately reported.  This allows our clients to better understand the freight cost structure and allows us to offer landed cost reporting at the pricing component level.  Surcharges are quoted “at cost” and are immediately increased AND reduced based on current carrier direct cost.  We remove surcharges from base pricing to insure unfair margins are not a burden during slack or low cost fuel periods.
